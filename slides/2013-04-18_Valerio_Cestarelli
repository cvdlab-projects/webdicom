# WebDicom - Block Decomposition

- - -

## Problem description:

- Block Decomposition of images
- Take Coordinates of blocks of interest

- - -
## Individual Task:

- We've found an algorithm implemented in Java.
- I'm going to modify and to readapt the algorithm to our purposes.

##Solution:

Initially, into the implementation found, there were multiple algorithms of decomposition.
We only took the one best suited to our purposes.
Has been inserted, in addition, a small GUI, which makes it simple to use the quadtree.

##Solution:

Readaptation of the algorithm to our purposes, in particular:
  Readaptation of parameters' values, to take contours of bones and particulars of interest.
  Extraction of well known format from Dicom images.

##Solution:

Other possibility:
- Take adiacent pixels of same color density and put they in the same cell.
